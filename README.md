# websiteVisualization_NYU-DS

This repository has the code for a visualization for NYU's Data services website that is currently under progress. The purpose of this code is to show data from the [webpage](http://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276822&p=3562711) in an interactive manner.

Mike Bostock's Hierarchical Edge Bundling visualization is being used as the reference and basis in the process of developing the first version of this visualization.

The final version of the visualization is based on this [Game of Thrones](http://thronesviz.github.io/) visualization.
