# websiteVisualization_NYU-DSS

This repository has the code for a visualization for NYU's Data services website that is currently under progress. The purpose of this code is to show data from the [webpage](http://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276822&p=2845922) in an interactive manner.

Mike Bostock's Hierarchical Edge Bundling visualization is being used as the reference and basis in the process of developing this visualization.
